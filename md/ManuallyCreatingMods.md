# Manually Moving/Creating Mods

If you are planning on using the mod launcher while creating mods there is a much faster way to upload your mods to the launcher

1. upload your mod as normal using the "Add Mods" button
2. Navigate to the root directory for AJ Launcher.exe or right click the mod and select "Open Mod Folder"
3. open the mods folder
4. you will see a folder with your mods title
5. open the folder (it should contain all of your mods files)
6. use that folder to change out the mod for updated ones
